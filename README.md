Here're some examples of A/B testing implementation, including design, split, and testing stages.

2 assignments are from the MTS School of Data Analysis course, which has a separate repository.
1 assignment is from the MIPT course on Applied Data Analytics, where almost an end-to end pipeline was implemented.

The python notebooks contain performed tests with the functionality of Ambrosia open-source library, which is extremely convenient for performing A/B pipelines.

Below are several links where you can learn more about the functionality of the Ambrosia library:
